# 3. Two Pointers

Generally speaking, Two Pointers is not an algorithm, but it is widely used in interview. Two Pointers can easily solve some problems in Array or String. Array is the first linear data structure we learnt since started programming, and it is the fundamental of our algorithm knowledge. Array and String are very similar, as `int[]` and `char[]` respectively. For string related problem we can use `toCharArray()` method to convert into an array to solve in the same idea.

### Summary

Two Pointers will usually be used in three manners:
- First-Last Pointers: Used to solve problems like 2 sum and partition.
- Slow-Fast Pointers: Used in circular linkedList, deduplication, string modification.
- Backwards Pointers: Used in starting from one point to expand window size.

Besides, Sliding Window is one advanced technique of Slow-Fast Pointers to solve substring/subarray related problem. Partition is another advanced usage of First-Last Pointers to solve sorting related problem.

A good generalization of Two Pointers is to use K Pointers to solve multiple input problems, such as K-way merge.

### [1. Two Sum Pattern](3_1_two_sum.md)

* 2 Sum - Unsorted/Sorted
* 2 Sum - Greater/Smaller/Closest/Difference
* 2 Sum - All Pairs/All Unique Pairs/Data Structure Design
* 3 Sum - Greater/Closest/Smaller/All Unique Pairs
* 4 Sum
* K Sum
