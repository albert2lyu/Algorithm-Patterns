# 2. LinkedList

LinkedList is another useful linear data structure in real work. The element in LinkedList is ListNode as following:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode prev; // for doubly linked list
}
```

Different from array, we can't random access the content in LinkedList. Usually we only have the access to the head of LinkedList, thus extra traversal will be needed as operations in LinkedList. The most useful ideas in LinkedList related problems is Slow-Fast Pointers and Recursion.
