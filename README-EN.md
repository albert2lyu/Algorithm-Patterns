Everything you need to know to prepare for a technical interview. Beginner-friendly tutorial of Data Structure and Algorithm, summary of categorized algorithm questions, and notes for Java and Object Oriented Design. English version tutorial will be updating regularly, please check my website: 

**[Algorithm Interview Preparation](https://dongxiaoran.com/en/algo/)  by dongxiaoran.**

Welcome to check my repository [LeetCode-Solution-Well-Explained](https://github.com/zdong1995/LeetCode-Solution-Well-Explained) with detailed explanations and comments for LeetCode questions in different categories. If this is helpful for you, please feel free to add a star to the repo. Thank you! ❤️

This repo will be updated as following parts:
- Part 1: Start from basic Data Structure and Algorithm to get good understanding of Recursion, use Two Pointers technique in large mounts of questions and  practice sorting algorithms.

- Part 2: Search algorithm, especially graph search. BFS, DFS, pruning, memoization, greedy and dynamic programming.

- Part 3: Popular problems and advanced data structure like Trie, Union Find, TreeSet, TreeMap.

- Part 4: Java and Object-oriented Programming.
