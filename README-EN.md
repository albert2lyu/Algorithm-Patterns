Welcome to check my repository [LeetCode-Solution-Well-Explained](https://github.com/zdong1995/LeetCode-Solution-Well-Explained) with detailed explanations and comments for LeetCode questions in different categories. If this is helpful for you, please feel free to add a star to the repo. Thank you! ❤️

This repo will be updated as following parts:
- Part 1: Start from basic Data Structure and Algorithm to get good understanding of Recursion, use Two Pointers technique in large mounts of questions and  practice sorting algorithms.

- Part 2: Search algorithm, especially graph search. BFS, DFS, pruning, memoization, greedy and dynamic programming.

- Part 3: Popular problems and advanced data structure like Trie, Union Find, TreeSet, TreeMap.
